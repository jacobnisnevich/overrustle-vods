# OverRustle VODs

**OverRustle VODs** is a simple web app that plays Destiny Twitch VODs with the destiny.gg/OverRustle chat along the side in real-time

## Running the Project

OverRustle VODs requires Ruby to run properly. I've tested with Ruby `2.2.1p85` using rvm on Ubuntu 14.04. To build the project simply run 

```
bundle install
```

to install all gem dependencies and then start the project with 

```
ruby app.rb
```
